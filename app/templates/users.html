<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  To update a BIOS or network card firmware in Linux traditionally meant
  rebooting into Microsoft Windows, or preparing a MS-DOS floppy disk (!) and
  hoping that everything would work after the update.
  Periodically searching a vendor website for updates is a manual and
  error-prone task and not something we should ask users to do.
</p>
<p>
  fwupd is a simple daemon to allow session software to update device firmware on
  your local machine. It's designed for desktops, but also usable on phones and
  headless servers.
  You can either use a GUI software manager like GNOME Software to view and apply
  updates, the command-line tool or the system D-Bus interface directly.
  Updating firmware on Linux is now automatic, safe and reliable.
</p>

<h2>Using GNOME Software</h2>

<h2>Using the command line</h2>
<p>
  fwupd ships a command line <code>fwupdmgr</code> program.
  This allows administrators to get the list of upgradable devices,
  schedule offline updates or installing firmware on the live system.
  You can manually download released firmware updates from the LVFS
  <a href="/lvfs/devicelist">device list</a>.

<h2>Using the D-Bus API</h2>
<p>
  The fwupd daemon is launched when queried for the first time.
  This exports an interface that can be queried from any language with
  a D-Bus binding such as C, Python or Java.
</p>
<a href="img/dbus.png"><img alt="d-feet screenshot" src="img/dbus.png"/></a>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ $ gdbus call --system --dest org.freedesktop.fwupd --object-path / --method org.freedesktop.fwupd.GetDevices 
({'ro__sys_devices_pci0000_00_0000_00_1d_0_usb2_2_1_2_1_4_2_1_4_1_0':

</pre>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
  By default, any users are able to update firmware for removable hardware.
  The logic here is that if the hardware can be removed, it can easily be moved to
  a device that the user already has root access on, and asking for authentication
  would just be security theatre.
</p>
<p>
  For non-removable devices, e.g. UEFI firmware, admin users are able to update
  trusted firmware without the root password.
  By default, we already let admin user and root update glibc and the kernel
  without additional authentication, and these would be a much easier target.
  The firmware updates and metadata are signed either with GPG or a PKCS-7
  certificate.
</p>

<h2>User Interaction</h2>
<p>
  No user interaction should be required when actually applying updates.
  Making it prohibited means we can do the upgrade with a graphical
  splash screen, without having to deal with locales or input methods.
</p>

<h2>Trusted Keys</h2>
<p>
  Installing a public key to <code>/etc/pki/fwupd</code> allows firmware signed with a
  matching private key to be recognized as trusted, which may require less
  authentication to install than for untrusted files.
  By default trusted firmware can be upgraded (but not downgraded)
  without the user or administrator password.
  Only very few keys are installed by default.
