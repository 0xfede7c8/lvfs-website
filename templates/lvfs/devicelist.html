<h1>Devices using LVFS for firmware updates</h1>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<p>
  This list shows all the updates that have been pushed to the stable metadata.
  This is a very incomplete list as a lot of the devices in the LVFS
  have not yet been released publicly and the firmware updates are in a
  secret embargoed state.
</p>
<p>
  This list is automatically generated and will be updated when new firmware
  is added or devices are released to the public.
