Hi,

We wanted to tell you an interesting CPU microcode has been uploaded to the LVFS and the firmware has now been made public.

cpuid: {{shard.get_attr_value('cpuid')}}
platform: {{shard.get_attr_value('platform')}}
version: {{shard.get_attr_value('version')}}

The microcode can be downloaded here: {{url_for('shards.route_download', component_shard_id=shard.component_shard_id, _external=True)}}

Regards,

The LVFS admins
